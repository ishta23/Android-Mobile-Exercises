	<h3> Necessity vs. Experience </h3>
	<p>
		As a user of a shower as well, taking a shower is necessary (as per society), but it is also the only time in the day I am not using active concentrating logic to do something and it is more a relaxation experience for me. So my goal for this UI is an balance between experience and basic controls.  <br>
	</p>
	<h3> The features and controls of this project </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>10 languages and 2 of them are implemented: French and English</li>
		<li> 4 saved preferences saved and 1 guest preference  </li>
		<li> Shower-Prune Test: Too much water used and cold water approaching </li>
		<li> Time</li>
		<li> Timer </li>
		<li> Weather </li>
		<li> Temperature and Scolding Water Awareness </li>
		<li> Music Player </li>
		<li> TV/Movie/Media Player </li>
		<li> Lights </li>
		<li> Background Image (Escapism) </li>
		<li> Shower control/ Spray Control and Bath Tub Water Level </li>
		<li> Bath Tub Water Level Signal </li>



	</uL>

	<h3> 5 User Settings </h3>
	<p>
		There are 5 user choices to choose from. They are big and bold so it can easily chosen. There are 4 saved preferences for the regular users of this application and one for guest.<br> Notice how guest is on top so it is easier to new user to touch it and it is at appropiate length.  If the user clicks on Anne, this is what is produced. <br>
		<img src="screenshots/anne.PNG" width="400" height = "300"> <br>
		Anne likes to take baths, with slow filling water, and likes to listen to music. Now all she has to do is press on. 
	</p>
	<h3> Prune test </h3>
		<img src="screenshots/temper.PNG" width="400" height = "300"> <br>
	<p> Click/Tap on the shower head or the black circle on the top of the right panel. It will have a red ring round it. This tells the user that they have been in the water too long and are pruney. It is a nice red color so it is easier to see and it tells the user that it is not healthy any more. I decided to do it by the showerhead because it shows how much water is coming out. This is new feature </p>

	<h3> Choose a Language </h3>
	<img src="screenshots/french.PNG" width="400" height = "300"> <br>
	<p>
		There are 10 langauges at the user can choose from but for the demo there are two: English and French (Francais). The user can click on either one and see how the time (12hr vs. 24 hr), the on/off button and the choose background changes. 
		Taking into account that users or guest might not speak English or don't understand a 12hr clock. So there are settings to change all of it and it can be used again after that. This was more a necessity rather than experience. 
	</p>
	<h3> Shower or Tub Use </h3>
	<p>
		For this demo there are 2 modes: <br> 
		Shower - standing in the shower <br>
		<img src="screenshots/shower.PNG" width="400" height = "300"> <br>
		This is where the user stands in the shower. So the controls are concentrated together at an appropiate height so it can reach by arm/hand and had appropiate eye level.<br>
		<ul>
			<li> Time and Weather are at top because they need to be seen not manipulated.</li>
			<li> Choose Language is at bottom because it does not get changed oftern </li>
			<img src="screenshots/waterfall.PNG" width="400" height = "300"> <br>
			<li>  There are more specific controls such as temperature, spray control, lights, music and media are more specific as the user goes down to finally turn on the shower. </li>
			<li> The music is pressed and it shows up on the left panel because the user tends to face away from the showerhead. The same applies to the tv/media/Netflix. This is more on the experience side, because the user can be warm and watch Ice Road Truckers as well. </li>
			<li> On the left panel, there is an option to choose a background image. I chose a waterfall because it reminds me of a Herbal Essence Commercial and how it feels like take a shower in a waterfall, minus bugs and mud. </li>
		</ul>
		BathTub - sitting in the shower <br>
		<img src="screenshots/bath.PNG" width="400" height = "300"> <br>
		<ul>
			<li> When the user is in BathTub mode, the shower elements stay the same because you turn on the bath and wait for it to fill, then step in, so the right panel is still appropiately located. </li>
			<li> Notice how the spray control gets changed to the water level of the bathtub. The user can choose to fill the tub how they like it. </li>
			<li> There is a copy of the temperature controls by the bottom inclined towards the left of the center panel so it is reachable by someone who is lying down. </li>
			<li> The music is located by the user when he lies down and when clicked, the music player shows up and the user can play around with it. </li>
			<li> The choose background is lowered down so the user can change the background image if they wish to have a scenic bath like by the beach or in a cave/hotsprings. </li>			
			<li>When the bath tub water level has reached the desired height. There is a selectable screen to see the icon for the demo.</li><br>

	<h3> Time, Weather, Timer </h3> 
	<p>
		This really cool bathroom shows you the time so you can not late. It shows you the weather so you know what clothes to wear when you get out. It also sets a timer for you so you don't hog the water for yourself. The timer display location changes based on if the user is in the bath or shower so it is visible by the user. There are located at eye level so it is easier to see. 
	</p>
	<h3> Temperature and Scolding Warning</h3>
	<img src="screenshots/temper.PNG" width="400" height = "300"> <br>
	<p>
		The temperature is simple. It is located on the right panel so it can be seen clearly and changed if need be.<br>
		Click on the top arrow of the temperature panel. See that if the temperature is too high, a red warning will show up showing that this temperature can scold you so shut it off and you cannot go any higher. <br>
		When the user is lying in a tub, there is a duplicate temperature controls so you can control the water temperature while lying down as well as when you started the bath.  

	</p>
	<h3> Light </h3>
	<p>
		The light is simple feature so click on it so comes on and off. It provides light into the bathtub if there is poor lighting needed. This is a nice feature that I would like in my bathroom, so it is a simple necesiity.
